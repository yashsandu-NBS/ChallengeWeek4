## ChallengeWeek4
This repository contains the solutions to the Challenge Week 4.

### What was the challenge?
Write a playbook that installs Docker onto the local machine.

Stretch Goals:
1. Create a Docker role.
2. Add a role that will deploy an Nginx container.

### How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected the base challenge to be very straightforward because it was explained very well in the video call. 
Any doubts was all cleared. I expected the stretch goal to be challenging as configuring roles can be tricky as there are lots of components to be handled.

### What went well?
The base challenge went really well. I got the base structure working very well. However, I did struggle with the service: start for Docker.
My initial approach was not right but after reading community again i made the relevant changes and it worked. 

The stretch goal went smoother than initially thought. Followed QA community on how to deploy NGINX contianer. 
However, it did require modifications to make it work.

### What didn't go as planned?


### Possible improvements for future challenges.
Keep praticing the tutorials and exercises. They really help to get better. 

Thank you Ben!
